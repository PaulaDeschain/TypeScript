# TypeScript
It is proposed to create some classes to store the logic of an agenda with the personal data of individuals: addresses, telephone numbers, emails...
The correct selection of types and the definition of functions necessary to access the attributes will be valued.

Once the classes are done:

A main module (main) will be created in which the defined classes are used to create 3 person records and display them in the terminal through console.log, using the necessary functions defined in the classes to obtain the data.
One of the added person records will be modified, performing the search by DNI and adding a new address, a new email and a new telephone. These changes must be made by using previously defined methods in the classes.
The 3 records with the changes previously made in the console will be displayed from the main module.
